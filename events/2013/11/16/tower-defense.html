The Gamebuild-a-thon details have been finalized. The Gamebuild-a-thon is on Saturday, November 16th from 11 am to 11 pm in Siebel 0220. We&#39;ll be in a Linux computer lab, so you can use the lab computers. You&#39;ll have 12 hours to take a basic tower defense game written in Pygame and make it awesome. Thanks to EA&#39;s generous sponsorship, we have prizes ranging from backpacks to T-shirts to video games for the top 3 teams. For more information and the full list of prizes, check out the wiki page. And make sure to sign up so we know how many teams to expect!</p>

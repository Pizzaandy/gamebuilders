<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to yet another Gamebuild-a-thon! Once again, sponsored by EA. This semester&#39;s competition will be a slightly different format: we&#39;re trying to make the competition less restrictive in terms of rules and theme. We have also extended the time: the competition will last <strong>24 hours</strong>. That should give you plenty of time and creative freedom to make a great game!</p>

<h1>The Theme</h1>

<p>Unlike in the past, we will not be requiring a genre of game for you to make. Instead, we will give you a theme. And that theme, decided by Gamebuilders exec, is <strong>Gotta go fast!</strong> So make a game about moving fast. It could require the player to have quick reaction time, or be about fast things, or something else. We didn&#39;t want to limit you, so be creative!</p>

<h1>Language and Framework</h1>

<p>This semester&#39;s required language is <strong>C++</strong>. We will be giving a lot less of a framework; we will providing a build system using Waf, and we&#39;ll be providing some useful libraries (the full list is below). This is to give you more freedom to develop your game the way you want it. We&#39;ll be providing some example code using Box2D to help newer programmers get started.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re new to game development in general, or new to using C++, we highly recommend you come to the general meeting on Tuesday, February 11th. We&#39;ll be running a tutorial on how to use C++, SFML, and Box2D, which should help inexperienced participants get started. And, as in past competitions, you can always ask questions on how to use the libraries at the competition itself.</p>

<p>The framework is posted on Github. Click <a href="https://github.com/GameBuilders/gamebase">here</a> to view it.</p>

<h1>Location</h1>

<p>We&#39;ll be in Siebel 2405 for the duration. </p>

<h1>Food</h1>

<p>We are planning to provide lunch at the beginning and the end of the competition, and snacks and drinks for the duration. However, as in past Gamebuild-a-thons, this may vary depending on the number of participants.</p>

<h1>Prizes</h1>

<p><strong>First Place</strong>: 2 EA backpacks and choice of 2 games from the list below</p>

<p><strong>Second Place</strong>: 2 EA water bottles, 2 EA USB drives, and the remaining 2 games from the list below</p>

<p><strong>Third Place</strong>: 2 EA bound Journals and 2 EA USB drives</p>

<p>The list of games available as prizes are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battlefield 4 (Xbox One)</li>
<li>Fifa 14 (Xbox One)</li>
<li>Madden 25 (PS4)</li>
<li>Need for Speed Rivals (PC)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Signing Up and Turning In</h1>

<p><strong>Signups are required for each team by the end of the competition (12:00 PM on Sunday).</strong> This means you can form teams on the day of the competition. If you plan to compete and you don&#39;t have a Github account, you&#39;ll need to get one. As a result of using Github, all games built for the competition will be publicly posted. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tEuqBpx3vwq1oqXYlS6rAsWeKLsIsrlbuffXXm5zFKI/viewform">here</a> to sign up for the competition.</p>

<h1>Finding Team Members</h1>

EA will be visiting campus from 2/17 to 2/18, and would like to meet the Gamebuilders. They&#39;ll be discussing EA&#39;s internship program and giving feedback on the games from the Gamebuild-a-thon. If you have a game and you&#39;d like to receive feedback on it from some professional game developers, we highly recommend you come. All are welcome! The location is <strong>Siebel 3401</strong>. The EA team will also be at Corporate Connections on 2/17, and will also be meeting with WCS. So if you can&#39;t make it to this event, there are still plenty of chances to meet with EA!</p>

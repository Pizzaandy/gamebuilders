EA will be visiting campus from 2/17 to 2/18, and would like to meet the Gamebuilders. They&#39;ll be discussing EA&#39;s internship program and giving feedback on the games from the Gamebuild-a-thon. If you have a game and you&#39;d like to receive feedback on it from some professional game developers, we highly recommend you come. All are welcome! The location is <strong>Siebel 3401</strong>. The EA team will also be at Corporate Connections on 2/17, and will also be meeting with WCS. So if you can&#39;t make it to this event, there are still plenty of chances to meet with EA!</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to yet another Gamebuild-a-thon! Once again, sponsored by EA. This semester&#39;s competition will be a slightly different format: we&#39;re trying to make the competition less restrictive in terms of rules and theme. We have also extended the time: the competition will last <strong>24 hours</strong>. That should give you plenty of time and creative freedom to make a great game!</p>

The Gamebuild-a-thon details have been finalized. The Gamebuild-a-thon is on Saturday, November 16th from 11 am to 11 pm in Siebel 0220. We&#39;ll be in a Linux computer lab, so you can use the lab computers. You&#39;ll have 12 hours to take a basic tower defense game written in Pygame and make it awesome. Thanks to EA&#39;s generous sponsorship, we have prizes ranging from backpacks to T-shirts to video games for the top 3 teams. For more information and the full list of prizes, check out the wiki page. And make sure to sign up so we know how many teams to expect!</p>
